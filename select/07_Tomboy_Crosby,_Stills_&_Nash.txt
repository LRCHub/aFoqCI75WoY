She's one of the guys, yeah and you can trust her
Tell her anything that she's so alive
She can shoot pool and she can really drive
She ain't afraid of nothin' 'cept maybe boys with their minds on lovin'

Tomboy
Always with the wrong boy
You need a strong boy
Tomboy, Tomboy

I don't understand she's never been close
To a lovin' man she goes all a-quiver over these fools
That won't bother with her she's so fine
What can't I do with this love of mine?

Tomboy
Always with the wrong boy
You need a strong boy
Tomboy, Tomboy

She's got a heart of gold givin' you everything
Put herself on hold thinks she can laugh enough
So you never see what she's coverin' up in her world
There's thousands of friends and one lonely girl

Tomboy
Always with the wrong boy
You need a strong boy
Tomboy, Tomboy

Tomboy
Always with the wrong boy
You need a strong boy
Tomboy, Tomboy
