Enough is enough, no one stops the Catarpillar
The weight of the world already too much to bear
You do it loud, mix it up with vanilla
The sound is the best I have heard for a million years

From the thunder that came I was never the same
And I would stop to think of what to do
I was taking a leap I was playing for keeps with you

The many touches on my skin
That's lying between now and then
The many kisses on my chin
So severe
I can't believe this state I'm in
I can't believe what's happening
We'll never be this young again
Guinevere

A comic relief that makes room for my decision
To tighten the rope so that you never will forget
The music that comes from when playing with precision
The words are too rough I can't shake it from off my head

I was making a mess for the better I guess
With a desire to be understood
There were people around with the need to get down for good

The many touches on my skin
That's lying between now and then
The many kisses on my chin
So severe
I can't believe what's happening
I can't believe the state I'm in
We'll never be this young again
Guinevere
